For example, a loom could have hundreds of cards with holes in each of them that correspond to hooks that can be raised or lowered to make a textile brocade. Below is an illustration of the Jacquard Loom attachment on top of a textile loom. The Jacquard Loom is important to the history of computers because it is the first machines to use interchangeable punch cards to instruct a machine to perform automated tasks (make different textiles). Having a machine that could perform various tasks is similar to todays computer programs that can be programmed to perform different tasks. The Jacquard Loom was also an inspiration to Charles Babbage planning to use perforated cards in his analytical engine. Herman Hollerith also used the idea of punch cards to not only store information but be used to input information into a computing device and is what help create the company IBM.'},
